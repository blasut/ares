# ares

Ongoing project, experimenting in NRE and word stuffs.

## What? How? Why?

### What?

Ares is a application for reading and analysing PDF files. The project was started with the idea of parsing the [publications](http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/108) from the Swedish government.

Parsing the files, is the easy part. The big part of Ares is doing word analyses of the publications, mostly through [NRE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition).

But also more simple analyses like "how many occurrences have this word?".

### How?

Through coding.

### Why?

Might be interesting to use for papers or journalists and I'm curious of the results.
